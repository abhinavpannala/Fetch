# FetchJob at Fetch
 Data Engineering ETL task

You will have to make a number of decisions as you develop this solution:
● How will you read messages from the queue?
● What type of data structures should be used?
● How will you mask the PII data so that duplicate values can be identified?
● What will be your strategy for connecting and writing to Postgres?
● Where and how will your application run?


For this assignment an ounce of communication and organization is worth a pound of execution.
Please answer the following questions:
● How would you deploy this application in production?
● What other components would you want to add to make this production ready?
● How can this application scale with a growing dataset.
● How can PII be recovered later on?
● What are the assumptions you made?
